1. COPYRIGHT
=============

You should have received a copy of the GPL along with this program.  It
is in the file COPYRIGHT.


2. WHAT IS YACCVISO?
====================

Note: throughout this file when I refer to "yacc" I mean both yacc and 
bison.

YaccViso is a tool for visualizing dependencies of non terminal and
terminal symbols in a yacc grammar. If you do not know what yacc is
then you probably won't need YaccViso. It is thus a tool specifically
designed for people who write compilers with yacc who work on large
grammar files.

YaccViso will take a yacc or bison file, parse it and produce two
dependency graphs: one which can be visualized using VCG[1] and one
which can be visualized using dot[2].

What do I mean by dependency?

If you have a yacc file of the form:

 %%
 start        	: declarations code 
		;
 declarations 	: declarations declaration
		;
 code         	: code statement
		; 
 .
 .
 .
 %% 

then YaccViso will generate a directed graph in which there are
directed edges from "start" to "declarations" and "code", etc. In
other words: the rule "start" depends upon "declarations" and "code"


3. WHY YACCVISO?
================

If you have ever written a large grammar such as the grammar for ANSI
C with more than 50 productions then you will have noticed that it
isn't easy to keep track on each terminal or non terminal symbol, what
it does etc. In such a case I recommend using YaccViso and printing
your dependency graph of your grammar as a huge poster so that you
have a handy reference.

What's more: as YaccViso generates an easily parsable output of a
directed graph, all the standard algorithms can be applied to this
graph and questions such as "which grammar symbol is used in only one
context and in which context?" can be answered automatically.  We plan
to incorporate some of these algorithms into YaccViso when time
permits.


4. REQUIREMENTS
===============

YaccViso should be compilable on any UN*X system which has:
 * bison or yacc (tested on both)
 * flex 2.5.4 or higher
 * GNU make (See Note gmake)
 * GNU C compiler (gcc). 

The Code should be highly portable except for the flex file.
I seldomly used any system specific calls except malloc, free, fprintf and
exit.

In addition you will need one or more of:
 1. VCG ("Visualization of compiler graphs") by Georg Sander
    obtainable at:
	ftp://ftp.cs.uni-sb-de/pub/graphics/vcg

 2. the graphviz package (contains dot, lefty, neato, dotty) by AT&T
    obtainable at:
	http://www.research.att.com:80/~north/graphviz/

For the actual visualization. I highly recommend using dot as it produces
a more aesthetic layout and as it is faster than VCG.


NOTE gmake:

The Makefile uses a few lines of conditionals. It was found that these
won't work on BSD make and OSF/1 make. Use GNU make (gmake) instead or
look at the Makefile and adapt it (it is a small Makefile) and remove
theses conditionals.


5. WHERE TO OBTAIN YACCVISO?
============================

Get it from my Web page: https://github.com/aaronkaplan/yaccviso. 
(I appreciate git pull requests in case you find any errors).


6. INSTALLATION
===============

 1) make a unique temporary directory
 2) copy the .tgz file into that directory
 3) ungzip it and untar it. Now you should have a directory structure
    like tmpdir
         |- README (this file)
         |- src/
         |- misc/
         |- doc/
         |- examples/

 4) Go into the directory src/ and type "gmake"
 5) ignore any warnings
 6) you should have an executable "yaccviso". Take it and copy it to any
    location that you want to have it.


7. DOCUMENTATION
================

The documentation in the directory doc/ is far from complete. It gives
some insight however. 


8. SYSTEMS ON WHICH YACCVISO WAS TESTED
=======================================

Redhat Linux 4.2, Pentium 166
DEC OSF/1, DEC Alpha
